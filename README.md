# üèÜ Tournament Scheduler with Genetic Algorithms
This project builds a smart scheduler for sports tournaments using Genetic Algorithms (GAs). It creates fair and efficient match schedules by avoiding issues like stadium conflicts and unfair rest periods.

## üéØ Goals of the Project
‚Ä¢	Automatically generate tournament schedules (e.g., round-robin).

‚Ä¢	Avoid common scheduling issues such as:

      o	Conflicting use of stadiums
      
      o	Uneven rest time between matches
      
      o	Imbalanced match distribution

‚Ä¢	Improve results using evolutionary techniques like GA and coevolution.

‚Ä¢	Compare multiple methods and visualize the outcomes.

‚Ä¢	Offer a simple user interface to interact with the scheduler.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries
| Task                       | Libraries Used                    |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Genetic Algorithm Engine   | `DEAP`, `PyGAD`                   |
| Constraints & Optimization | `NumPy`, `PuLP`                   |
| Visualization              | `Matplotlib`, `Plotly`, `Pandas`  |
| User Interface (Optional)  | `Streamlit`, `Tkinter`            |
| Logging & Experimentation  | `SciPy`, `logging`, `PrettyTable` |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
‚Ä¢	Schedules are represented as individuals in a GA population.

‚Ä¢	Fitness function checks for:

      o	Double-booked venues
      
      o	Fair rest periods
      
      o	Balanced scheduling

‚Ä¢	GA operators include:

      o	Selection: Tournament, Roulette
      
      o	Crossover: Order crossover (OX), PMX
      
      o	Mutation: Swap, Insertion

‚Ä¢	Optionally, a multi-island approach can be used to evolve solutions in parallel.


## üîç What We Test
The project compares different configurations by changing:
‚Ä¢	Population size

‚Ä¢	Mutation and crossover types

‚Ä¢	Constraint handling methods
Results are visualized using graphs to show how the fitness improves over generations. Baseline methods like greedy algorithms are also compared.

## üìä Outputs
‚Ä¢	Final match schedules are saved in results/schedules/

‚Ä¢	Performance graphs and logs are saved in results/plots/ and results/logs/

## ‚úÖ Final Deliverables
‚Ä¢	A working Python tool that creates valid tournament schedules

‚Ä¢	Built-in constraint handling for real-world scenarios

‚Ä¢	Charts, comparisons, and a GUI for exploration

‚Ä¢	A full write-up documenting the approach and findings
